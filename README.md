# An appscan-issue-gateway-2 for AppScan Enterprise(ASE) helps to synchronize issues between ASE and issue management systems like Jira. This capability  helps AppScan users to get the security issue data "pushed" into other systems thereby avoiding building all the REST calls and plumbing. For seamless  synchronization capability, this service itself operates as a REST API. An ideal use case of this service is implemented in an automated scanning  workflow where it is called for issue processing.  

## Prerequisites:

1.  A Node JS runtime of version 16.16.0  
2.  HCL Appscan Enterprise installation  
3.  A supported Issue Management system: Jira  

## Installation steps

1.  Install the Node JS runtime of version 16.16.0 (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.  Download the binaries from the repository.
3.  Open the command prompt from the home directory and run the command "npm install". This installs all the required npm libraries.
4.  Edit the file '.env' from home directory to make changes to the below properties.  
     ASE_URL = \<URL of the AppScan Enterprise. \>  
     SECURE_PORT = \<Port Gateway application listens to\>  
     SSL_PFX_CERT_FILE = \<Path to certificate in pfx format.\>  
     SSL_PFX_CERT_PASSPHRASE = \<Certificate passphrase/password\>  
     APP_LOG = \<Path and name of the log file\>  
     MAXLOGSIZE = \<Maximum size of the log file\>  
     NUMBER_OF_BACKUPS = \<Number of backups\>
     IM_PROVIDER = \<Provider Name. Ex: JIRA\>
     SYNC_INTERVAL = \<Start the sync thread to push data from AppScan to Issue Management System. 1 means synchronizer runs everyday to push issues identified in the previous day. 2 means synchronizer runs once in 2 days to push issues identified in last 2 days. \>
5.  Start the 'Gateway' application running the command "npm start" from the home directory.
6.  Access the APIs swagger page using the URL https://\<hostname\>:\<port\>/ase/api/swagger. You can get this URL from the console/log.
7.  Use the API to provide Issue Management details and start the synchronizer.
7.  To install/uninstall the application as a Windows Service run below commands from home directory.  
    node service.js --install  
    node service.js --uninstall
8.  If installing the service failed following the step 7, follow the below steps.
      Download the nssm utility from "https://nssm.cc/download"
      Launch the nssm.exe from win64 folder by running the command 'nssm.exe install "HCL Issue Gateway"'

## Known Issues & Limitations
1.  The JIRA support only handles Basic Auth (username and password)
2.  A robust automated test suite is required.
3.  The service is English only and need to go through a String externalization exercise.
